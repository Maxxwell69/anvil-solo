# üõ°Ô∏è "Virus Detected" - False Positive Explained

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a FALSE POSITIVE - Your App is Safe!

Your antivirus/Windows Defender is flagging your legitimate software. This is **extremely common** with unsigned Electron apps.

---

## üîç Why This Happens

### **Reason 1: Unsigned Executable**

```
Your app: Not code-signed
Antivirus: "I don't know this developer"
Result: Flagged as suspicious
```

**Solution:** Code signing certificate ($100-300/year)

---

### **Reason 2: Packed JavaScript**

```
Electron apps contain:
- Node.js runtime (compressed)
- JavaScript code (packed)
- Native modules (compiled)

Antivirus sees:
- "Self-modifying code" (Electron startup)
- "Obfuscated scripts" (bundled JS)
- "Unknown binary" (not in database)

Result: Heuristic detection triggers
```

**This is NORMAL for Electron apps!**

---

### **Reason 3: New File / Low Reputation**

```
Your file:
- Never seen before by antivirus
- No download history
- No reputation score

Antivirus logic:
- "New unknown file + executable = SUSPICIOUS"
```

**Solution:** Time and downloads (build reputation) or code signing
