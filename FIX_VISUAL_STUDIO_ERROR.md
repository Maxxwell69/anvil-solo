# üîß Fix Visual Studio Error

## The Problem

```
Error: Could not find any Visual Studio installation to use
‚®Ø node-gyp failed to rebuild 'bigint-buffer'
```

**Why:** Native Node modules (`better-sqlite3`, `bigint-buffer`) need C++ compiler to build, but you don't have Visual Studio Build Tools installed.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Solution 1: Skip Native Rebuild (Fastest)

Use the new script that skips rebuilding:

```bash
BUILD-INSTALLER-NO-REBUILD.bat
```

**Then:**
```bash
COPY-INSTALLER-TO-DOWNLOADS.bat
```

This tells electron-builder to use pre-built binaries instead of recompiling.

**Time: 3-5 minutes**

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Install Build Tools (If Solution 1 Fails)

If you need to rebuild native modules:

### Option A: Visual Studio Build Tools (Recommended)

1. **Download Visual Studio Build Tools:**
   https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   
   Scroll down to "Tools for Visual Studio"
   Download "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022"

2. **Install with these workloads:**
   - ‚úÖ Desktop development with C++
   - ‚úÖ Node.js build tools

3. **Reboot** your computer

4. **Run the build script again:**
   ```bash
   BUILD-INSTALLER-SIMPLE.bat
   ```

**Time: 30-60 minutes (large download)**

### Option B: windows-build-tools (Faster)

Run as **Administrator**:

```bash
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

This installs Python and Visual Studio Build Tools automatically.

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

Then run:
```bash
BUILD-INSTALLER-SIMPLE.bat
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Use Pre-built App (Skip Building)

If building is too complex, you can:

1. **Run the app directly without installer:**
   ```bash
   cd anvil-solo
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This runs the app without creating an installer.

2. **For users, tell them to do the same** (not ideal, but works)

## üìä What Each Solution Does

### Skip Rebuild (Recommended ‚≠ê)
```
‚úÖ Fast (3-5 min)
‚úÖ No Visual Studio needed
‚úÖ Uses pre-built binaries
‚ö†Ô∏è Might not work if native modules are critical
```

### Install Build Tools
```
‚úÖ Proper solution
‚úÖ Works for all native modules
‚ùå Slow (30-60 min)
‚ùå Large download (several GB)
```

### Run Without Building
```
‚úÖ Fastest (immediate)
‚úÖ No installation issues
‚ùå Users need Node.js
‚ùå Not user-friendly
```

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Try Skip Rebuild (Fastest)
```bash
BUILD-INSTALLER-NO-REBUILD.bat
```

### Step 2: If That Works
```bash
COPY-INSTALLER-TO-DOWNLOADS.bat
```

### Step 3: Test the Installer
```bash
# Install it on your computer
# See if it works
anvil-solo\release\Anvil-Solo-Setup-3.0.0.exe
```

### Step 4: If It Doesn't Work
Then install Build Tools and rebuild properly.

## üîç Why This Happens

### Native Modules in Your App:
- **`better-sqlite3`** - SQLite database (used for local storage)
- **`bigint-buffer`** - Binary data handling (used by Solana)

These are **compiled C++ modules** that need:
1. C++ compiler
2. Python 2.7 or 3.x
3. Windows Build Tools

### Solutions:
1. **Skip rebuild** - Use pre-compiled versions
2. **Install tools** - Compile them yourself
3. **Remove them** - Don't use these modules (breaks features)

---

## üß™ Test if Skip Rebuild Worked

After building with `BUILD-INSTALLER-NO-REBUILD.bat`:

1. **Check if installer exists:**
   ```
   dir anvil-solo\release\*.exe
   ```
   Should show ~100-150 MB file

2. **Install it:**
   Double-click the installer

3. **Run the app:**
   See if it launches and works

4. **Test SQLite:**
   Try creating a wallet or strategy
   (Uses better-sqlite3)

If everything works ‚Üí **You're good!** ‚úÖ

If app crashes when using database ‚Üí **Need to install Build Tools** ‚ùå

## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Try this first (3-5 min):
BUILD-INSTALLER-NO-REBUILD.bat

# Then copy:
COPY-INSTALLER-TO-DOWNLOADS.bat

# Test:
cd cloud-services
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/downloads/windows-setup
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Nothing Works

Alternative: **Don't build locally, use GitHub Actions**

Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build Installer

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    
    - name: Install and Build
      run: |
        cd anvil-solo
        npm install
        npm run package
    
    - name: Upload Installer
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: installer
        path: anvil-solo/release/*.exe
```

Push to GitHub and it builds in the cloud (with all tools installed)!

## ‚úÖ Summary

**TL;DR:**

1. **Run:** `BUILD-INSTALLER-NO-REBUILD.bat` ‚≠ê Try this first!
2. **If fails:** Install Visual Studio Build Tools
3. **If still fails:** Use GitHub Actions to build

**Fastest path: Skip rebuild!** üöÄ
