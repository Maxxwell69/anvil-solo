# 🔧 Delete Modal & Fee System - DEBUG BUILD

## ✅ Issues Fixed & Enhanced Logging

### 1. Delete Modal Not Closing - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: After clicking "Delete Permanently", the modal stayed visible and you had to click Cancel and refresh.

**Root Cause**: Event listeners were only attached once when the modal was first created. Subsequent clicks didn't have working event listeners.

**Solution**: 
- Modal is now completely **recreated every time** you click delete
- Fresh event listeners attached each time
- Modal is **automatically removed** after deletion or cancellation
- Clean state guaranteed

**What Happens Now**:
1. Click 🗑️ Delete button
2. Modal appears with confirmation
3. Click 🗑️ Delete Permanently
4. **Modal closes automatically**
5. **Strategy is deleted**
6. **Dashboard refreshes**
7. **You stay on dashboard** (no need to manually refresh)

### 2. Fee System - Enhanced Debug Logging ✅

**Problem**: Fees weren't being collected on trades, but unclear why.

**Solution**: Added **comprehensive logging** to track exactly what's happening with fee collection:

**New Console Output** (when a trade executes):
```
🔍 Checking fee collection...
📊 Fee config: enabled=true, percentage=0.5%, wallet=82wZpbqx...
💵 Trade amount: 0.100000 SOL
💰 Fee amount: 0.000500 SOL (500000 lamports)
💸 Transferring 0.5% fee: 0.000500 SOL...
✅ Fee collected successfully!
📝 Fee transaction: https://solscan.io/tx/[SIGNATURE]
```

**If Fees Are Disabled**:
```
🔍 Checking fee collection...
📊 Fee config: enabled=false, percentage=0.5%, wallet=82wZpbqx...
ℹ️ Fee collection disabled
```

**If Fee Wallet Not Configured**:
```
🔍 Checking fee collection...
📊 Fee config: enabled=true, percentage=0.5%, wallet=NOT SET
⚠️ Fee wallet address not configured
```

**If Fee Collection Fails**:
```
🔍 Checking fee collection...
📊 Fee config: enabled=true, percentage=0.5%, wallet=82wZpbqx...
💵 Trade amount: 0.100000 SOL
💰 Fee amount: 0.000500 SOL (500000 lamports)
💸 Transferring 0.5% fee: 0.000500 SOL...
❌ Fee collection failed: [ERROR MESSAGE]
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Delete Modal Fix

1. **Install new version**
2. **Create a test strategy** (any type)
3. **Go to Dashboard**
4. **Click 🗑️ Delete** on the strategy
5. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Modal appears
   - ✅ Text is correct (no duplicates)
   - ✅ Strategy type shown correctly
6. **Click 🗑️ Delete Permanently**
7. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Modal closes immediately
   - ✅ Success message appears

---

### Test Fee System

1. **Open DevTools** (🔧 button in bottom right)
2. **Click Console tab**
3. **Create a DCA strategy**:
   - Small amount (0.01 SOL)
   - Quick interval (hourly)
4. **Start the strategy**
5. **Wait for first trade**
6. **Look for fee logs** in console:
   ```
   🔍 Checking fee collection...
   📊 Fee config: enabled=?, percentage=?, wallet=?
   ```

7. **Diagnose based on logs**:

   **If you see**: `enabled=false`
   - **Problem**: Fees are disabled
   - **Solution**: Enable in database or settings

   **If you see**: `wallet=NOT SET`
   - **Problem**: Fee wallet address not configured
   - **Solution**: Set wallet address in database

   **If you see**: `✅ Fee collected successfully!`
   - **Problem**: Fees ARE working!
   - **Solution**: Check the fee transaction link in console
   - **Verify**: Go to https://solscan.io/tx/[SIGNATURE]

   **If you see**: `❌ Fee collection failed: [ERROR]`
   - **Problem**: Error in fee transfer
   - **Solution**: Read error message for details
   - **Common errors**:
     - Insufficient balance
     - Invalid fee wallet address
     - Network issues

## 🔍 Debugging Fee Collection

### Check Fee Configuration

**Via Console (in app)**:
```javascript
// Open DevTools console and run:
window.electron.fees.getConfig()
```

Expected response:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  config: {
    feeEnabled: true,
    feePercentage: 0.5,
    feeWalletAddress: '82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd'
  }
}
```

### Check Fee Wallet Balance

Go to: https://solscan.io/account/82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd

**Look for**:
- Incoming SOL transfers (these are fees)
- Transfer amounts should be 0.5% of trade amounts
- Transfer timestamps should match trade times

---

## 📊 Expected Fee Amounts

| Trade Amount | Fee (0.5%) | Lamports |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 0.01 SOL | 0.00005 SOL | 50,000 |
| 0.05 SOL | 0.00025 SOL | 250,000 |
| 0.10 SOL | 0.00050 SOL | 500,000 |
| 0.50 SOL | 0.00250 SOL | 2,500,000 |
| 1.00 SOL | 0.00500 SOL | 5,000,000 |

**Note**: Fees < 1 lamport are skipped (only happens for trades < 0.000002 SOL)

---

## 🛠️ Manual Fee Configuration

If fees aren't working, you can manually check/set the configuration.

### Check Database

1. Navigate to app data directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\anvil-solo\
   ```

2. Open `database.db` with SQLite browser

3. Check `settings` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM settings WHERE key LIKE 'fee_%';
   ```

   Should see:
   ```
   fee_enabled = true
   fee_percentage = 0.5
   fee_wallet_address = 82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd
   ```

### Fix Fee Configuration

If values are wrong, update:
```sql
UPDATE settings SET value = 'true' WHERE key = 'fee_enabled';
UPDATE settings SET value = '0.5' WHERE key = 'fee_percentage';
UPDATE settings SET value = '82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd' WHERE key = 'fee_wallet_address';
```

Then **restart the app**.
