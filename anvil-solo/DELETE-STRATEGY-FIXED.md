# ✅ Delete Strategy - FIXED

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Text in Delete Modal ✅
**Problem**: The confirmation message appeared twice:
```
Are you sure you want to permanently delete this DCA strategy?
Are you sure you want to permanently delete this DCA strategy?
This will remove the strategy from your dashboard and cannot be recovered.
```

**Root Cause**: The modal update code was selecting the first `<p>` tag (the warning) instead of the second `<p>` tag (the confirmation question), causing it to overwrite the warning text.

**Fix**: Updated the code to properly select the second paragraph for updating:
```javascript
// Old code (wrong):
modalContent.querySelector('p').innerHTML = `Are you sure...`;

// New code (correct):
const paragraphs = modalContent.querySelectorAll('p');
if (paragraphs.length > 1) {
  paragraphs[1].innerHTML = `Are you sure...`;
}
```

### 2. Delete Button Not Working ✅
**Problem**: When clicking "🗑️ Delete Permanently", the strategy wasn't deleted and the user stayed on the same page.

**Root Cause**: After successfully deleting the strategy, the code reloaded the strategies list but didn't navigate back to the dashboard page.

**Fix**: Added `showPage('dashboard')` to navigate back after deletion:
```javascript
if (result.success) {
  console.log(`✅ Strategy #${strategyId} deleted successfully`);
  
  // Show success message
  showStatusMessage(`✅ Strategy #${strategyId} deleted successfully`, 'success');
  
  // Navigate to dashboard (NEW!)
  showPage('dashboard');
  
  // Reload strategies to update the dashboard
  await loadStrategies();
  
  // Also reload dashboard stats
  await loadDashboardStats();
}
```

## ✅ Now Working Correctly

   This will remove the strategy from your dashboard and cannot be recovered.
   ```
