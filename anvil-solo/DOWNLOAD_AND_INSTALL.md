## 🔒 Security Notes

### "Windows protected your PC" Warning?
If you see this message:

```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app
```

**This is normal for new software.** To continue:

1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

This happens because the installer isn't code-signed yet. Your antivirus may also flag it - this is a false positive.

### Is it safe?
✅ **Yes!** The software is safe. The warning appears because:
- New software without a code signing certificate
- Windows being extra cautious

Your private keys are encrypted and stored **only on your computer** - they never leave your device.
