# üöÄ UPLOAD NEW VERSION WITH FEE COLLECTION

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

The **transaction fee collection system** has been successfully integrated into all trading strategies:

- ‚úÖ **DCA Strategy**: Collects 0.5% fee on every buy/sell
- ‚úÖ **Ratio Strategy**: Collects 0.5% fee on all trades
- ‚úÖ **Bundle Strategy**: Collects 0.5% fee on all buys and sells

### How It Works
After each successful trade, the system automatically:
1. Calculates 0.5% of the trade amount
2. Transfers it to admin wallet: `82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd`
3. Logs the fee transaction to the database
