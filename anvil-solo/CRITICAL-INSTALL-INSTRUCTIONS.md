## 🧪 Test After Installing

### Step 1: Create Another Small Test
1. **Go to DCA tab**
2. **Create test strategy**:
   - Any token
   - Direction: Buy
   - Total: **0.01 SOL** (very small test)
   - Orders: 1
   - Interval: Hourly

### Step 2: Start and Watch Logs

1. **Go to Dashboard**
2. **Start the strategy**
3. **Watch console** in DevTools
4. **Look for**:
   ```
   🔍 Checking fee collection...
   📊 Fee config: enabled=true, percentage=0.5%, wallet=82wZpbqx...
   💵 Trade amount: 0.010000 SOL
   💰 Fee amount: 0.000050 SOL (50000 lamports)
   💸 Transferring 0.5% fee: 0.000050 SOL...
   ✅ Fee collected successfully!
   📝 Fee transaction: https://solscan.io/tx/[SIGNATURE]
   ```

### Step 3: Verify on Solscan

1. **Copy the fee transaction signature** from console
2. **Go to**: `https://solscan.io/tx/[SIGNATURE]`
3. **Look for**:
   - SOL transfer
   - To: `82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd`
   - Amount: 0.5% of your trade

## 📊 Why the Previous Trade Had No Fee

The transaction you just ran:

```

**Had NO fee because:**
1. You were running the **old version**
2. Your database **didn't have fee settings**
3. The fee system **thought fees were disabled**
4. No fee was collected

**After installing the new version:**
1. Database migration **adds fee settings**
2. Fee system **sees fees are enabled**
3. Each trade **automatically collects 0.5% fee**
4. Fee is **transferred to admin wallet**

Send me:
1. **Console logs** from startup (showing migration)
2. **Console logs** from trade execution (showing fee collection attempt)
3. **Screenshot** of the logs
