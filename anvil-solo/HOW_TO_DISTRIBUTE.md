## üì§ Step 3: Copy to Download Server

### Automated Method (Recommended)

DISTRIBUTE-TO-USERS.bat
```

This copies:
- ‚úÖ Installer executable
- ‚úÖ SHA-256 checksum
- ‚úÖ All user documentation
- ‚úÖ Download page HTML

### Manual Method
```bash
# Copy installer
copy anvil-solo\release\Anvil-Solo-Setup-3.0.0.exe cloud-services\public\downloads\anvil-solo-setup.exe

# Copy checksum
copy anvil-solo\release\*.sha256.txt cloud-services\public\downloads\

# Copy docs
copy anvil-solo\*.md cloud-services\public\docs\
```

---

## üåê Step 4: Deploy to Server

### If Using Railway

```bash
cd cloud-services
git status                               # Check what's changed
git add public/downloads/ public/docs/   # Stage files
git commit -m "Release Anvil Solo v3.0.0"
git push                                 # Deploy to Railway
```

Railway will automatically:
- Build and deploy
- Make files available
- Update the live server

### If Using Other Hosting

Upload these files to your web server:
- `public/downloads/anvil-solo-setup.exe`
- `public/downloads/*.sha256.txt`
- `public/docs/*.md`
- `public/docs/download.html`

---

## üîó Step 5: Share Download Links

### Primary Download Link
```

## üêõ Common Distribution Issues

### Issue: Download is Slow
**Cause:** Large file size + server bandwidth

**Solutions:**
- Use CDN for distribution
- Compress installer (already optimized)
- Use download mirror
- Upgrade hosting plan

---

### Issue: Users Can't Download
**Cause:** Server offline, wrong URL, or firewall

**Solutions:**
- Verify server is running
- Test download link yourself
- Check server logs
- Provide alternative download source

---

### Issue: Antivirus Flags Installer
**Cause:** Unsigned executable

**Solutions:**
- Expected for new software
- Add instructions to user docs
- Consider code signing certificate ($100-300/year)
- Submit to Microsoft SmartScreen for reputation

---

### Issue: Installation Fails for Users
**Cause:** Insufficient permissions, corrupted download

**Solutions:**
- Tell users to "Run as administrator"
- Verify checksum matches
- Provide alternative download link
- Check if antivirus is interfering

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Code Signing (Optional but Recommended)

**Why:** Eliminates "Windows protected your PC" warnings

**How:**
1. Purchase code signing certificate ($100-300/year)
   - DigiCert
   - Sectigo
   - GlobalSign
2. Sign the installer before distribution
3. Windows will trust it immediately

**Command to Sign:**
```bash
signtool sign /f certificate.pfx /p password /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 "Anvil-Solo-Setup-3.0.0.exe"
```

### Checksum Verification

Always provide SHA-256 hash:
1. Generate during build (BUILD-AND-VERIFY.bat does this)
2. Share hash publicly (website, email, Discord)
3. Users can verify with: `certutil -hashfile installer.exe SHA256`

### Secure Distribution Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS for all download links
- [ ] SHA-256 checksum provided
- [ ] Checksum shared via multiple channels
- [ ] Download page on secure domain
- [ ] Server access logs monitored
- [ ] Malware scan before distribution
