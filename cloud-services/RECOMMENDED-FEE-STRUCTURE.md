# 💰 Recommended Trade Fee Structure

## 🎯 Your 4-Tier Trade Fee System

**Each tier has its own trade fee percentage that you set in admin panel.**

---

## 📊 Option 1: Incentivize Upgrades (Recommended)

**Higher tiers = Lower fees** (encourages upgrades)

| Tier | Monthly Price | Features | **Trade Fee** |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 DCA only | **10%** ⚠️ High fee |
| **Tier 1** | $29.99 | 2 DCA + 1 Ratio + Cloud | **5%** 📉 Lower |
| **Tier 2** | $59.99 | 3 DCA + 3 Ratio + 3 Bundle | **2.5%** 📉 Even lower |
| **Tier 3** | $99.99 | Unlimited All | **1%** 📉 Lowest |

### **Why This Works:**
- Free tier gets highest fee (10%) → Motivates upgrade
- Each paid tier gets better fee rate
- Clear value proposition for upgrading
- More revenue from free users who don't want to pay monthly

### **Revenue Impact:**
```
Free user trading 100 SOL output: 10 SOL fee
Tier 1 user trading 100 SOL output: 5 SOL fee  
Tier 2 user trading 100 SOL output: 2.5 SOL fee
Tier 3 user trading 100 SOL output: 1 SOL fee
```

## 📊 Option 2: Flat Fee (Current Default)

**Same fee for all tiers**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Features | **Trade Fee** |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 DCA only | **0.5%** |
| **Tier 1** | $29.99 | 2 DCA + 1 Ratio + Cloud | **0.5%** |
| **Tier 2** | $59.99 | 3 DCA + 3 Ratio + 3 Bundle | **0.5%** |
| **Tier 3** | $99.99 | Unlimited All | **0.5%** |

### **Why This Works:**
- Simple and fair
- Users upgrade for features only
- Predictable costs
- Good for marketing ("Same low 0.5% fee for all!")

## 📊 Option 3: Hybrid Model

**Moderate fees that balance revenue and upgrades**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Features | **Trade Fee** |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 DCA only | **5%** |
| **Tier 1** | $29.99 | 2 DCA + 1 Ratio + Cloud | **3%** |
| **Tier 2** | $59.99 | 3 DCA + 3 Ratio + 3 Bundle | **2%** |
| **Tier 3** | $99.99 | Unlimited All | **0.5%** |

### **Why This Works:**
- Balanced approach
- Free users pay reasonable fee
- Incentive to upgrade
- Power users (Tier 3) get best rate

## 💡 **How It Works When Trading:**

### **Example: User Makes a Swap**

**Scenario:**
- User has Tier 1 license
- Swaps 10 SOL for 1,000 USDC
- Tier 1 trade fee: 5%

**Calculation:**
```
Output: 1,000 USDC
Fee: 1,000 × 5% = 50 USDC worth in SOL
Your wallet receives: ~0.25 SOL (50 USDC equivalent)
```

**Anvil Solo Calls:**
```javascript
POST /api/trades/record-trade
{
  "licenseKey": "ANVIL-XXX",
  "tradeSignature": "5x7Y...",
  "tokenOut": "USDC",
  "amountOut": 1000,
  ...
}

Response:
{
  "tradeFee": {
    "feePercentage": 5.0,  // From Tier 1 config
    "feeAmountSol": 0.25,
    "feeRecipientWallet": "82wZpbqxXAq5qFUQey3qgjWvVrTf8izc9McByMdRHvrd"
  }
}
```
