              MAKE GITHUB REPO PUBLIC - FIX USER DOWNLOADS
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Users get 404 when trying to download (only admin works)
REASON:  Your GitHub repo is PRIVATE
FIX:     Make it PUBLIC (2 minutes)

================================================================================
                            QUICK STEPS
================================================================================

1. GO TO SETTINGS:
   https://github.com/Maxxwell69/anvil-solo/settings

2. SCROLL TO BOTTOM
   Find "Danger Zone" (red box)

3. CLICK "Change repository visibility"

4. SELECT "Make public"
   (Radio button)

5. TYPE TO CONFIRM:
   anvil-solo

6. CLICK:
   "I understand, make this repository public"

DONE! Repo is now public!

================================================================================
                        THEN UPLOAD RELEASE
================================================================================

7. GO TO RELEASES:
   https://github.com/Maxxwell69/anvil-solo/releases/new?tag=v3.0.0

8. FILL IN:
   Title: Anvil Solo v3.0.0
   Description: Professional Solana Trading Bot

9. UPLOAD FILE:
   Drag: anvil-solo\anvil-solo-portable.zip (127 MB)

10. CLICK:
    "Publish release"

DONE! All users can now download!

================================================================================
                        WHAT HAPPENS
================================================================================

BEFORE (Private Repo):
  Admin: Can download ✅
  Users: 404 error ❌

AFTER (Public Repo):
  Admin: Can download ✅
  Users: Can download ✅

Everyone can access the release files!

================================================================================
                        IS IT SAFE?
================================================================================

YES! Making the repo public is SAFE because:

✅ License system protects your revenue (not code hiding)
✅ API keys are on Railway (not in code)
✅ Database is private (on Railway)  
✅ Users still need license for premium features
✅ Standard practice (VS Code, Slack, Discord all public)

What gets public:
  - Source code (TypeScript)
  - Documentation
  - Build scripts

What stays private:
  - Your Railway servers
  - API keys (env vars)
  - Database
  - User data
  - Admin access

================================================================================
                        ALTERNATIVE
================================================================================

If you want to keep repo PRIVATE, you have 2 options:

Option A: Use Google Drive
  - Upload file to Google Drive
  - Share public link
  - Update dashboard to use Drive link
  - Limited downloads, not professional

Option B: Use Cloudflare R2 (Free CDN)
  - Create R2 bucket
  - Upload file there
  - Update dashboard to use R2 link
  - Professional, unlimited downloads

RECOMMENDED: Make GitHub public (easiest and best!)

================================================================================
                        AFTER MAKING PUBLIC
================================================================================

Test immediately:

1. Logout of GitHub (or use incognito)
2. Visit: github.com/Maxxwell69/anvil-solo/releases/tag/v3.0.0
3. Click download
4. Should download WITHOUT login ✅

Then test from dashboard:
1. Login as regular user
2. Go to Downloads tab
3. Click Download
4. Should work! ✅

================================================================================
                        VIRUS WARNINGS
================================================================================

Users WILL see virus warnings because app is UNSIGNED.

I've updated download pages with instructions:
  ✓ "This is a false positive"
  ✓ How to allow download
  ✓ How to whitelist in antivirus

This is NORMAL for unsigned software!

To fix properly: Buy code signing certificate ($300/year)

For now: Tell users to allow/whitelist (already documented)

================================================================================

DO THIS NOW:
  1. Make repo public (2 min)
  2. Upload release (3 min)
  3. Test download (instant)

Total time: 5 minutes
Result: All users can download!
