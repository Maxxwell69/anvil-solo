## ⚠️ Why Portable Instead of Installer?

The full NSIS installer had build errors (Visual Studio Build Tools needed), so I created a **portable version** instead:

### Advantages of Portable:
✅ No installer needed
✅ Faster download (127 MB vs 150 MB)
✅ Works immediately
✅ Can run from USB
✅ Easy to move/delete
✅ No registry entries
✅ Multiple instances possible

### Users Just:
1. Extract zip
2. Run .exe
3. Done!

Even simpler than an installer!
